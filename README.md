# SQLCoder Fine-Tuning for SQL Code Generation

This repository provides a comprehensive guide for fine-tuning the SQLCoder model (based on LLaMA 3) specifically for SQL code generation tasks. By following this guide, you'll be able to train SQLCoder on custom SQL data, making it more effective at generating SQL queries tailored to your unique needs.

## Introduction

SQLCoder is a powerful variant of LLaMA 3, optimized for SQL code generation tasks. Fine-tuning SQLCoder enables it to adapt to specific SQL databases, applications, or complex queries, making it highly valuable for domain-specific tasks.

Fine-tuning applications include:

- **Automated SQL Query Generation**: Create SQL queries based on natural language descriptions.
- **SQL Code Optimization**: Refine or refactor SQL code for improved performance.
- **Business Intelligence Automation**: Generate analytical SQL queries for reporting.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.8 or later**: Required to run the scripts.
2. **Transformers Library**: Needed for working with SQLCoder/LLaMA models.
3. **PyTorch**: Essential for model training.
4. **CUDA (Optional)**: For GPU-based training.

### Installation

First, create a virtual environment and install the necessary libraries from `requirements.txt`.

```bash
python3 -m venv sqlcoder_env
source sqlcoder_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: sqlcoder_env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

These packages are required for model training, data handling, and tokenization.


Dataset Preparation
To fine-tune SQLCoder, prepare a dataset containing SQL queries and natural language descriptions. The dataset should ideally be in JSONL format, where each entry includes a prompt (description) and a completion (SQL query).

Example Data Format

```
{"prompt": "Fetch the names of employees from the 'employees' table", "completion": "SELECT name FROM employees;"}
{"prompt": "Get the total sales from the 'orders' table", "completion": "SELECT SUM(sales) FROM orders;"}
```


## Fine-Tuning Process

The fine-tuning is managed through the Hugging Face `Trainer` API.

1. **Load the Model and Tokenizer** : Begin with a pre-trained SQLCoder model and tokenizer.
2. **Set Up Training Arguments** : Specify batch size, learning rate, and other training parameters.
3. **Load and Tokenize Dataset** : Use `datasets` to preprocess the data.
4. **Training** : Use the `Trainer` class to train the model.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the fine-tuned model using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and BLEU score. This helps verify how well the model performs SQL code generation.

## Usage

Once the model is fine-tuned, it can be used to generate SQL code based on natural language prompts.

```
prompt = "Retrieve employee names from the 'employees' table where department is 'Sales'."
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

## Applications

Fine-tuning SQLCoder enhances its abilities in various applications:

* **Data Analytics** : Automatic SQL code generation for reporting and analytics.
* **Database Management** : Simplifying complex queries.
* **Natural Language to SQL** : Transforming natural language prompts into SQL for non-technical users.
